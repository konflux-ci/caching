# Git Operations Safety Rules

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY CONFIRMATIONS

**NEVER execute these commands without explicit user confirmation:**

### Git Commit Operations
```
BEFORE: git commit
REQUIRED: Show commit message â†’ Ask "Should I commit with this message? (y/n)" â†’ Wait for approval
```

### Git Push Operations  
```
BEFORE: git push, git push --force, git push --force-with-lease
REQUIRED: Ask "Should I push this to remote? (y/n)" â†’ Wait for approval
```

### Other Destructive Operations
```
BEFORE: git reset --hard, git rebase, git merge
REQUIRED: Ask for explicit confirmation before execution
```

## Required Confirmation Pattern

```
Generated commit message:
---
[commit message content]
---

Should I commit with this message? (y/n)
```

**Only proceed after user responds with "y", "yes", or explicit approval.**

## Exception: Read-Only Operations

These operations do NOT require confirmation:
- `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`
- `git branch --show-current`  
- `git remote -v`
- Any command that only reads/displays information
