    # Deny requests to certain unsafe ports
    http_access deny !Safe_ports

    # Deny CONNECT to other than secure SSL ports
    http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

    # Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
    http_access allow localhost manager

    # This default configuration only allows localhost requests because a more
    # permissive Squid installation could introduce new attack vectors into the
    # network by proxying external TCP connections to unprotected services.
    http_access allow localhost

    # The two deny rules below are unnecessary in this default configuration
    # because they are followed by a "deny all" rule. However, they may become
    # critically important when you start allowing external requests below them.

    # Protect web applications running on the same server as Squid. They often
    # assume that only local users can access them at "localhost" ports.
    http_access deny to_localhost

    # Protect cloud servers that provide local users with sensitive info about
    # their server via certain well-known link-local (a.k.a. APIPA) addresses.

    # INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS

    # For example, to allow access from your local networks, you may uncomment the
    # following rule (and/or add rules that match your definition of "local"):
    http_access allow localnet
